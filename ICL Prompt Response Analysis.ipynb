    "- With a success rate of 88%, this experiment needs more consideration possibly in terms of prompt engineering. \n",
    "- **Hypothesis**: The model would understand the task using the examples presented even if the examples are syntatically put together (not necessarily a cohesive sentence). However, the ability of the model to recall the birth year of a person is not conditioned on the syntax or the number of examples provided. "
