1,128,128,Johann Nikolaus Von Dreyse,Johann Nicolaus von Dreyse,"inventor , entrepreneur",german,1787,1787,2,"johann nicolaus von dreyse -lrb- november 20 , 1787 -- december 9 , 1867 -rrb- was a german firearms inventor and manufacturer .
he is most famous for submitting the `` dreyse needle gun '' in 1836 to the prussian army , which was adopted for service in december 1840 as the `` leichte perscussions-gewehr m 1841 '' -- a name deliberately chosen to mislead about the rifle 's mechanism -- later renamed zündnadelgewehr m 1841 in 1855 .
dreyse was born in sömmerda -lrb- then ruled by the archbishopric of mainz -rrb- , the son of a locksmith .
dreyse worked from 1809 to 1814 in the parisian gun factory of jean-samuel pauly , a swiss who designed several experimental breech-loading military rifles .
returning to sömmerda , he in 1824 founded a company to manufacture percussion caps .
it was there that he designed the needle rifle .
while the gun is thought of by some to be the first bolt-action rifle , in reality it bears little resemblance to modern bolt-action rifles , except for the bolt principle itself which was applied to close the breech .
ammunition for the dreyse rifle was made up of paper cartridges holding the bullet into a sabot .
the gun 's needle penetrated the paper cartridge before igniting the black powder charge .
the dreyse 's simple construction made it relatively easy to keep clean and in operation .
for instance , worn needles could be quickly replaced without dismantling the bolt mechanism .
the dreyse rifle was a significant ordnance improvement for its time , since it permitted a much faster rate of fire than the muzzle-loading rifled muskets which were the standard of world 's armies until the mid-1860s .
it also enabled riflemen to reload without standing and exposing themselves to fire .
the dreyse rifle was used by the prussians during the austro-prussian war , at the battle of königgrätz , and the franco-prussian war .
by that time , the gun was fast becoming obsolete , and was outclassed by the french bolt action `` mle '' 1866 chassepot rifle .
other bolt action rifle designs had emerged in other countries .
for example , in 1869 switzerland adopted the bolt action vetterli rifle which was a tube magazine rimfire metallic cartridge repeater .
the french transformed the 11mm chassepot into a metallic cartridge bolt action rifle , the `` mle '' 1874 gras .
germany had also switched earlier to an 11mm metallic cartridge with the entirely new mauser model 1871 bolt action rifle .
great britain and the u.s. evolved from muzzle loaders to metallic cartridge breech loaders , but with systems other than bolt action , during that same period .
there remains some ambiguity about the activities of von dreyse after he created the needle-gun , as he seems to have dropped the `` johann '' part of his name and was known as `` nikolaus von dreyse '' .

shaikh , who had never been assessed by mental health experts , denied he was mentally ill .
he had requested a psychiatric evaluation to prove he was sane , but the requests were refused by chinese authorities on the grounds that prc laws required defendants to first provide past medical records showing evidence of a mental disorder before such evaluations could be undertaken .

his two main series are the alex benedict series and the priscilla hutchins series .
mcdevitt 's first published story was `` the emerson effect '' in `` the twilight zone magazine '' in 1981 .
five years later , he published his first novel , `` the hercules text '' , about the discovery of an intelligently conceived signal whose repercussions threaten human civilization .
this novel set the tone for many of mcdevitt 's following novels , which focused on making first contact .
frequently this theme is mixed with both trepidation before the unknown and a sense of wonder at the universe .
with `` the engines of god '' -lrb- 1994 -rrb- , mcdevitt introduced the idea of a universe that was once teeming with intelligent life , but contains only their abandoned artifacts by the time humans arrive on the scene .
although it was initially written as a standalone novel , the main character of `` the engines of god '' , pilot priscilla hutchins , has since appeared in six more books , `` deepsix '' -lrb- 2001 -rrb- , `` chindi '' -lrb- 2002 -rrb- , `` omega '' -lrb- 2003 -rrb- , `` odyssey '' -lrb- 2006 -rrb- , `` cauldron '' -lrb- 2007 -rrb- and `` starhawk '' -lrb- 2013 -rrb- .
the mystery surrounding the destructive `` omega clouds '' -lrb- which are introduced in `` the engines of god '' -rrb- is left unexplored until `` omega '' .
mcdevitt 's novels frequently raise questions which he does not attempt to answer .
he prefers to leave ambiguities to puzzle and intrigue his readers : `` some things are best left to the reader 's very able imagination . ''
the sf site 's steven h silver has written about this : the novel `` seeker '' won the 2006 nebula award for best novel , given by the science fiction and fantasy writers of america .
he has been nominated for the nebula award sixteen times ; `` seeker '' is his only win .
